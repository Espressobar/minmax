# minmax
This project uses STM32 and Arduino technology to re-mineralize water by dosing pre-mixed concentrates of dissolved minerals in amounts dictated by recipes, stored (local, remote) or ad-hoc. It is primarily intended as a system for designing and sharing recipes for water for coffee.

# Vision
The vision for this project is based on the importance of water in coffee and was inspired by Maxwell and Hendons work. A major challenge for roasters is ensuring that the quality of the coffee is properly reflected in the homes of customers using whatever brewwater they'll be using. Some caf√©s offer up their own water, but this is not a great long term solution. Ultimately, in the future, i'd like a cheap water design system (this one) in each home which also has local access to distilled water. Users can then purchase mineral concentrates at their local grocery store, have the system detect the type of mineral and offer a range of recipes using those minerals. Being able to replicate the water of a roastery located on the other side of the planet is a major improvement in allowing consumers to enjoy the coffee more closely to what the roaster intended.

If cupping results are undesireable, the system should also help the user make adjustments to recipes by asking simple questions and hiding away the complexities of water chemistry.
